# ðŸ§  RGB vs IR Image Classification using CNN

This project involves building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify images as either **RGB (visible spectrum)** or **Infrared (IR)**. The dataset is derived from the **CAVE multispectral image dataset**, where RGB and IR bands were extracted and labeled accordingly.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Build a CNN classifier to distinguish between RGB and IR images.
- ðŸ§  **Model**: Custom Convolutional Neural Network (TensorFlow/Keras).
- ðŸ“Š **Dataset**: Prepared using spectral bands from the CAVE dataset.
- ðŸ“¦ **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## ðŸŒˆ Why This Project?

- Understands how models learn spectral differences between visible and IR bands.
- Forms the foundation for downstream tasks like **cross-modality image translation**, **domain adaptation**, or **multispectral vision**.
- Helps in building intuition for **preprocessing and band selection** from complex datasets like CAVE.
